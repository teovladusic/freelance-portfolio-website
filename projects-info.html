        <h4>Picking the right architecture</h4>
        <p>
          After knowing the requirements I will choose the correct software
          architecture. This step is very important because of 2 things.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If You have a very complex application with a big code base, it will
          be very hard for any new developer to read, change and maintain the
          code. Even the developer who originally created the app will have a
          hard time dealing with the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If you have a small, not that complex application, You can save a
          lot of money on development by not making the architecture perfect.
          The biggest advantage of using these architectures is that you can
          separate your code into many little pieces that only do one specific
          thing. So when you change one of them, all other pieces will not be
          affected. In smaller projects, there isn’t much complexity, so the app
          will still be maintainable.

          So, we agreed on terms, picked the right architecture. Now we can
          start implementing Your solution. You only have to wait, and check the
          updates which I regularly send. The very important thing is that we
          discuss any problems or changes as soon as we can. The common thing is
          that You want to change some features and remove the old ones. In this
          case, You spend Your money on coding the wrong feature as well as
          changing it.
